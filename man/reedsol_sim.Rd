\title{Simulate from a Reed-Solomon distribution}
\usage{
reedsol_sim(data, n = 1, q = 256, k = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A numeric vector used to generate the Reed-Solomon curve.}

\item{n}{Integer. Number of samples to generate. Default is 1.}

\item{q}{Integer. Size of the finite field GF(q). Should be a prime number or power of prime.
Default is 256 (2^8).}

\item{k}{Integer. Degree of the polynomial to use. If NULL (default), uses the length of data.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of length n containing samples from the Reed-Solomon distribution.
}
\description{
This function simulates random samples from a probability distribution based on
Reed-Solomon codes. It takes a vector of data, creates a polynomial-based curve,
normalizes it, and generates samples using rejection sampling.
}
\details{
The function works by:
\enumerate{
\item Converting input data to elements in GF(q)
\item Constructing a probability density function as a polynomial with coefficients from the data
\item Normalizing this function through numerical integration
\item Using rejection sampling to generate random samples
}

The distribution domain 0 to q-1, corresponding to the elements of GF(q).

\examples{
# Generate a single sample using small data and field size
reedsol_sim(c(1, 2, 3), n = 1, q = 8)
