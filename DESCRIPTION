Description: Provides tools for simulating from probability distributions derived
    from Reed-Solomon codes. Reed-Solomon codes <doi:10.1137/0108018> are a class
    of error-correcting codes that have applications in data transmission and
    storage. This package implements rejection sampling methods to generate random
    samples from distributions where the probability density function is constructed
    using polynomial structures similar to those found in Reed-Solomon encoding.
    The reedsol_sim() function can be used to simulate values from these
    distributions.
